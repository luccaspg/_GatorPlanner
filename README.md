I found this GitHub repo that has the coordinates for the parking lots and is separated by decal:

https://github.com/Rolstenhouse/uf_api

https://campusmap.ufl.edu/library/cmapjson/parking_lots.json

The issue is that the JSON file only shows coordinates so it's hard to know which parking lot is which.

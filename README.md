Deployed on Heroku
Sticked with the mean stack as the technology stack 
Added some additonal features not mentioned in our wireframes such as the implementation/look of the list view 
Added more detail to the admin page with the additional buttons. However kept to the overall look and feel of the wireframes. 

Stuck with a single web application as to provide ease when planning courses. We felt it would be more effort to switch through multiple pages than just stay on one page and have all functions within. Defined the admin in the database with only the option to create a new one from a current admin. This was a security measure as we didn't want students editing/deleting courses. We have blocked out elements from the page based on your status as an admin/student.
